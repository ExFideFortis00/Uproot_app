# UpR00T

#### Introduction ####
Intro: UpR00T is an app for these people who have ever needed to move (read: everyone). Whether across the street, across town, or across the country, moving sucks. Period. No app, or service can help that. UpR00T aims to make the process a little less sucky.

Problem Being Solved: There are currently no, or little to no, tools designed exclusively to help consumers manage the process of moving. While individual tools exist to catalog furniture and other move items, find movers in your area, coordinte travel, find a new home, reserve storage space, etc., there are no solutions to manage all of these important elements from one central dashboard. 

Solution: Using the power of APIs(#UnderConstruction) and databases, we can now pull all of these functions into one application. Allowing you total access to all aspects of your move from one central location.
